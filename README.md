# 📊 Students' Social Media Addiction – Tableau Dashboard & Python Analysis

This project explores behavioral patterns and academic impact among students who actively use social media, using a dataset of 700+ entries from multiple countries. The dashboard is built with **Tableau Desktop** and designed for **research storytelling**, combining demographic insights, behavioral trends, platform-specific usage, and global comparisons.

In addition to Tableau, a comprehensive **Python Jupyter Notebook** is included for data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze the relationship between students' social media usage and key indicators such as:
- Sleep habits
- Mental health
- Academic performance
- Platform preference
- Geographic differences

This project aims to support **researchers, educators, and mental health professionals** in understanding how social media habits influence student well-being.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Young female students** (18–21) have the highest daily usage rates.
- Increased screen time correlates with **lower mental health** and **less sleep**.
- **TikTok and Instagram** users report **higher addiction** and academic struggles.
- Significant **regional variation** in usage habits — with some countries showing higher addiction and usage hours.

## 🐍 Python Notebook: Data Science & Predictive Modeling

The included Jupyter Notebook (`Social_Media_Analysis.ipynb`) documents the full data science workflow:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Automated model selection using Lazypredict
- Building and evaluating a predictive model for student social media addiction scores

This notebook complements the Tableau dashboard by providing transparency, reproducibility, and deeper statistical insights.
